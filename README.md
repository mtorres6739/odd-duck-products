# Odd Duck Products Application

## Problem Domain

The focus group results have been collected and the Odd Duck Products team is ready to go into production! The results were so positive that the marketing team would also like to make these products available for online purchase. 

Your task is to bring functionality to an order form page and a shopping cart page.

## Process

1. JavaScript was coded to add the items from the drop down menu into local storage.  Once stored, they would appear on the cart.html page.
2. One on the cart.html page, user will have the option to remove products by clicking on an 'X' next to the item.
3. The item would then be removed from local storage.
4. CSS was then added to configure the layout and look of the page.
